So while using python we decided to analyze the gdp fluctuations of countries hosting
the summer olympics. Now in order to limit the amount of factors affecting our data we
decided to sample 3 summer olympics hosts being Spain, The United States, and South
Korea from the years 1980-1992 to avoid the most amount of significant economic events
such as the 2008 recession and Covid. Typically when a coutry hosts the olympics, they
spend alot of time and money building facilities to accomadate for the events such as
gyms, stadiums, parking lots, and estates for the athletes. All this development creates
jobs within the country and promotes things like tourism which can temporarily boos the 
earnings of a country. The problem emerges however after the games are over since many
facilities are left into disrepair much to the dismay of the host country such as was the
case in 2008 after the Beijing olympics. That being said after, looking at all the gdp 
development within the 8 year time period of their olympic hosting, we almost always
saw a staedy increase in GDP (save for some freak outside influences like covid). Now 
unfortunately, just because we found a correlation doesnt mean we can conclude it was 
causation. Many more things go into a countries economy other than contruction and tourism
so to say that the olympics was the sole cause of a countries growth would be irresponsible.
Additionally, the olympics tend to almost always be hosted in a country with a strong and
growing economy just like the west so ultimately there is no baseline to tell if the olympics 
really had much of an impact. All in all, there is simpy too much to come to a sure conclusion
of if the olympics affects a host countries economy but the data we anayzed tends to lean to
yes it does.
