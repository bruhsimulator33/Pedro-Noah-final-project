Provide a project title, a short description of your dataset, and the big question you want to answer in your project.
Title: The Summer Olympics The world economy's golden goose?

Dataset 1: a description of medals won in teh summer olympics from 1896-2024 providing date, teams, names, and events
Dataset 2: every countries overall GDP growth from 1980-1987
Dataset 3: changes in every countries inflation, interest rates, and unemployment rates from 1970-2021 

Our big question to answer is how big of a driving factor are summer olympics results in the global economy.

Provide the URL(s) where the data can be downloaded.

Write five (or six) possibly interesting questions about your dataset that can be answered using SQL (from "Analyze your data using SQL" requirements) - Note that you can change these questions and at this point they can be simple.
1. how do the summer olympics affect the GDP of a countries host city in the 4 years leading up (every world cup term)
2. how do the results of the summer olympics affect the winning teams unemployment rate (most medals)
3. how do the results of the summer olympics affect the losing teams unemployment rate (least medals)
4. how do the results of the summer olympics affect the losing teams GDP (least medals)
5. how do the results of the summer olympics affect the Winnig teams GDP (most medals)
6. how does the GDP of the host country change 4 years after the summer olympics (every summer olympic term)
7. how does the amount of medals won correlate with a countries GDP growth for that year

Provide a quick summary on how you will divide up the work between members of the group.

Pedro Castellon: find useful datasets (questions 4-6) (split number 7)

Noah Bull: Find useful data sets (questions 1-3) (split number 7)


In general, provide enough detail so that I can understand the scope of your project. Convince me that your project is worthy!
We simply want to see how the summer olympics affects the global economy. Many cities see economic booms and downfalls before and after the summer olympics occurs
If we can see if there is a correlation between summer olympics results, their location and the involved countries economy, we may have a very interesting story to tell!
